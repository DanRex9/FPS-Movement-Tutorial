# FPS-Movement-Tutorial
This is a fps movement tutorial.

# Prerequisites
Before approaching this tutorial, you will need a current version of Unity and a code editor (such as Microsoft Visual Studio Community) installed and ready to use.

This tutorial was created with Unity 2022.3 LTS and Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 versions. It should work with earlier or later versions. But you should check the release notes for other versions as the Editor controls or Scripting API functions may have changed.

You will have to know how to create 3d objects in unity and how to create folders and organise your files in the projects folder.

# Objectives
In this tutorial, we will be writting scripts and understanding how to make an fps movement mechanism.

# Getting Started
Once you have created your 3d unity project the first thing will be to create an empty in the hierarchy panel and name it `Player`, right click on player and create a capsule and we are also going to call this `Character`. Staying in the hierarchy select the `Main Camera` and drag it into `Player` now you should have both the camera and character as childs of yuur Player. Click the `Main Camera` and in the transfor window right click and reset its position this will get the camera righ in the center of our capsule, press `Y` and along the `Y Axixs` take it to the top of the capsule. By this point your project shuld look like this.
